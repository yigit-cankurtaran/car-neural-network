# Car Neural Network with JavaScript

- In this project I will implement freeCodeCamp's JavaScript self driving car.

- My goals with this project are:
    1. Learning how neural networks work.
    2. Learning how neural network can be implemented.
    3. Simulating a real world problem and solving it with JavaScript

## After Project Thoughts
- I learned a lot about how neural networks work, but other than that the project wasn't too productive.
- I think I should have used a different language for this project, because I had to use a lot of workarounds to make it work.
- There were so many unknown errors while following the tutorial, that I frequently had to rewrite it.
- I intend to finish my next projects faster, and write them in a more suited language like Python.
