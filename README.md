# Car Neural Network with JavaScript

- In this project I will implement freeCodeCamp's JavaScript self driving car.

- My goals with this project are:
    1. Learning how neural networks work.
    2. Learning how neural network can be implemented.
    3. Simulating a real world problem and solving it with JavaScript
